#Earn Lockpicking Karate Flair

As a way to have fun (and to poke a little fun at Six Sigma) this sub gives its members the opportunity to earn user flair in the form of karate belts. Belt flair is issued based on the accomplishments of the member, with each higher level requiring increased community participation and the picking of increasingly difficult locks.

Karate Belt Flair is entirely optional and members will go "unranked" until they specifically requests ranking by [messaging the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flockpicking).

Remember this is all just for fun... In the end, no matter what karate belt you wear, you're still just wearing fancy pajamas.

***********************************


##Rules

- We will add your flair, but it's up to you to show it. You must select the option **"show my flair on this subreddit"** in order for your belt ranking to be visible.

- Your accomplishments must be demonstrated on locks that are **NOT IN USE**. Your photographs and videos must clearly show a lock that is not protecting anything.

- Your photographic proof must be clear and in focus. **The plug must be shown in the turned position** with no key in it. Basically in a position it could not otherwise be unless it had been picked.

-  Your video proof must show the lock picked and gutted in one continuous shot with no cuts. The video should be clear, well lit, and the lock should stay in frame at all times. If you have privacy concerns, [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) provides an option to password protect your videos. /u/Kitteh_of_Dovrefjel has [created a great video guide](https://youtu.be/gcekRz-7If8) to explain how to pick and gut your locks on video. Also [please say "no" to vertical video.](https://youtu.be/Bt9zSfinwFA?list=PLB68C543E6A2BCC74)

- Some of the higher belts require for you to help or mentor others. Be friendly, courteous, and patient with them as you provide advice.

- Some of the higher belts require you to have made a tool. This requirement cannot be met by having used a paper clip, bobby pin or the like. You must actually make a specialized tool.

- Blue Belt Picker and higher require that you "have custom pinned a lock meant to challenge another picker". Preferably this lock will make it into circulation and introduce you to the fun of exchanging locks designed not for security but specifically to defeat picking.  If for some reason you are unable/unwilling to fully engage with the larger community of exchange we still encourage you to gain the more in-depth knowledge of how locks function that comes from building your own.  [Speak to a moderator](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flockpicking) about the requirements for pinning and picking your own creation.

- The list of locks is a living document. If you believe you have picked a lock that is equivalent to one of those listed in the requirements, [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flockpicking). We will research the lock and add it to the list.

- If you would like to be initially ranked or believe you have met the requirements for the next rank, compile links that demonstrate your accomplishments and [submit them to the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flockpicking). We will evaluate them and issue you your new belt. **You do not need to begin at "White Belt Picker"**; send us links to your accomplishments and we will initially rank you at the appropriate level.

- The requirements are cumulative, so **you need not repeat the previous requirements to earn a new belt**. For example, if you are a "Green Belt Picker" you have already demonstrated that you can gut and reassemble locks. You do not need to demonstrate this again when moving up to "Blue Belt Picker".

- Acrylic, cutaways, and other designs of locks that allow you to have a clear view of the inside of the lock will not count any higher than a white belt, even if it's a black-belt level lock.

##Challenge lock definition

A "**custom pinned lock meant to challenge another picker**" defined as:

A commercially made lock **and working key** that includes **a minimum of SIX modifications by the lock builder**. Number of modifications must **total or exceed SIX** and may include any or all of the following:

* Turned, sculpted or shaped key pins
* Turned, sculpted or shaped driver pins
* Modification to the chambers by threading or counter-milling
* Improvised secondary locking mechanism
* Distinguishing mark engraved into the lock

Stipulations:

* Each **"turned, sculpted or shaped" key pin** counts as one modification. Pins must be shaped BY the builder, **removing no less than 15%** of the original material
* Each **"turned, sculpted or shaped" driver pin** counts as one modification. Pins must be shaped BY the builder, **removing no less than 15%** of the original material
* **Pin-in-pin** counts as one "turned, sculpted or shaped" pin per pin modified. Shaping a pin and also making it pin-in-pin does not count as two modifications
* **Chamber threading** counts as one "modification" regardless of the number of chambers augmented
* **Chamber counter-milling** counts asone "modification" regardless of the number of chambers augmented
* Each **improvised secondary locking mechanism** counts as one modification (latches, check pins, etc)
* **"Distinguishing mark" engraved into the lock** counts as one modification (**Simple scratches do not count**. Engraving must be a symbol or mark of the maker)

[Speak to a moderator](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flockpicking) if you have ideas about creating a challenge lock that does not fall within this definition.

##FAQ

* Question: Must I begin at "White Belt Picker" and progress through the ranks, or can I skip directly to the belt that is appropriate for me?
 * Answer: You can skip directly to the belt that is appropriate for you. Just compile a list of your accomplishments in accordance with the guidelines and request to be issued the belt you are going for.

* Question: My lock is SFIC or some other really difficult to gut core and I don't want to risk ruining it. Can I still use this to qualify for a belt?
 * Answer: Maybe. [Let us know what you're thinking](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flockpicking) and we will try to work with you to find a way of meeting the requirement.

* Question: I don't make lockpicking videos. Can I use a photograph for the higher levels instead?
 * Answer: No. While we understand that people have privacy concerns, the gold standard for Locksport is to video your accomplishments as a way of sharing them with the community. The video does not have to be public and you can remove it as soon as we have reviewed it, but does need to be a video that meets the standards outlined in the "Rules" section. For those not wanting to share public videos, we are suggesting that you use [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) and select the option to password protect your video.

* Question: I already have a Six Sigma black belt. Can I trade this for a lockpicking belt?
 * Answer: No, but you get points for making us LOL :)

* Question: Can I use this belting system for my club or picking group?
 * Answer: Of course. Please feel free to use this system in any and all ways you like.

* Question: Will I be disqualified it I shoot the video vertically?
 * Answer: No, but for the betterment of the world, [please say "no" to vertical video](https://youtu.be/Bt9zSfinwFA?list=PLB68C543E6A2BCC74).
